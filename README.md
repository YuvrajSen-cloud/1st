# 1st project from roadmap.sh

So i just was learning dsa got to know about stack how it work and though wait a min i could use it in this code so thats what i did main concept is of a stack which will take our string values store them, remove them when completed, show all the tasks from (newest to oldest) thats the huge mistake of this code i mean it works perfectly right now and we all know "If it works dont change it"..

i also added a random task function which will give 6 random tasks what if you dont want to add a taks and just get a pre made one so.

if reading this hope you will like this concept..
